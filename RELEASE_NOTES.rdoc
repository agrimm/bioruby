== Incompatible changes and removed features

=== Bio::FlatFile use binmode (binary mode) when opening a file

In Bio::FlatFile.open and Bio::FlatFile.auto, binmode (binary mode) is used
by default when opening a file, unless text mode is explicitly specified
with open mode string or with options. Due to the change, files using CR+LF
line separator might not be read correctly.

=== Bio::KEGG::KGML

* Bio::KEGG::KGML::Reaction#substrates and Bio::KEGG::KGML::Reaction#products
  are changed to return an array containing Bio::KEGG::KGML::Substrate and
  Bio::KEGG::KGML::Product objects, respectively. The changes enables us to
  get ID of substrates and products that were thrown away in the previous
  versions.
* Most attribute methods that were different from the KGML attribute names
  are renamed to the names compatible with the KGML attribute names. Old
  method names are changed to aliases of them and marked as deprecated.
  The old names will be removed in the future.
  * Bio::KEGG::KGML::Entry#id (old name: entry_id)
  * Bio::KEGG::KGML::Entry#type (old name: category)
  * Bio::KEGG::KGML::Entry#entry1 (old name: node1)
  * Bio::KEGG::KGML::Entry#entry2 (old name: node2)
  * Bio::KEGG::KGML::Entry#type (old name: rel)
  * Bio::KEGG::KGML::Reaction#name (old name: entry_id)
  * Bio::KEGG::KGML::Reaction#type (old name: direction)
* Following attribute methods are deprecated because two or more graphics
  elements may exist in an entry element. They will be removed in the future.
  Instead, please use instance methods of Bio::KEGG::KGML::Graphics, which
  can be obtained from Bio::KEGG::KGML::Entry#graphics attribute.
  * Bio::KEGG::KGML::Entry#label
  * Bio::KEGG::KGML::Entry#shape
  * Bio::KEGG::KGML::Entry#x
  * Bio::KEGG::KGML::Entry#y
  * Bio::KEGG::KGML::Entry#width
  * Bio::KEGG::KGML::Entry#height
  * Bio::KEGG::KGML::Entry#fgcolor
  * Bio::KEGG::KGML::Entry#bgcolor

=== BioRuby development

* rdoc.zsh is removed because it have not been used for a long time.
